# Hello world!, I'm Franco
### FullStack Web Developer || Industrial Designer

ðŸ’» I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong Front-End orientation. As an Industrial Designer I am specialized in Product Design and I obtained a UX Design certification to be able to use my expertise in software development.

ðŸ›  The top technologies I am learning are JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js and MySQL, among others.

ðŸŽ“ My professional experience has been inclined towards branding and strategic design for points of purchase, having the most biggest corporations as clients  like L'OrÃ©al Paris. In Spain, I had the opportunity to work as a Graphic Designer working for advertising agencies.

ðŸ“¡ I am passionate about technologies and science. Above all, everything related to computers.

ðŸ•¹ Computers are my favorite hobby, I consider myself a geek since I was a child. Also, I like other things like mountain biking, outdoor adventure, and video games.
