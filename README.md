# Hello world!, I'm Franco
### FullStack Web Developer || Industrial Designer 

ðŸ’» I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a solid Front-End orientation. As an Industrial Designer, I am specialized in Product Design and I have obtained a UX Design certification to use my expertise in software development.

ðŸ›  The top technologies I am learning are JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, HTML/CSS, and MySQL, among others.
