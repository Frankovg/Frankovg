# Hello, world!, I'm Franco
### FullStack Web Developer || UX/UI Designer || Industrial Designer 

💻 I am a Front-end Developer with a background as an Industrial Designer. To complement my skill set, I earned a UX Design certification that seamlessly integrates into my software development proficiency.

🛠 The top technologies I am working with are Typescript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind. I also work with Back-End essentials with Node.js and SQL.

👨‍💻 Currently, I work as a Front-End developer at A-SAFE Digital, a software enterprise affiliated with A-SAFE (UK).

🕹 I'm passionate about technology and all facets of computing. Beyond the digital realm, I also like mountain biking, outdoor adventures, and video games.
