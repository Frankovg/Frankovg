# Hello world!, I'm Franco
### FullStack Web Developer || Industrial Designer 

💻 I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong Front-End orientation.  With a background in Industrial Design, my expertise lies in Product Design. To complement my skill set, I earned a UX Design certification that seamlessly integrates into my software development proficiency.

🛠 The top technologies I am working with are Typescript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind. My familiarity extends to Back-End essentials with Node.js and SQL.

👨‍💻 Currently, I am actively engaged as a Front-End developer at A-SAFE Digital, a software enterprise affiliated with A-SAFE (UK). I also contribute to the creation of interface designs for our products.

🕹 My passion revolves around technology and all facets of computing. Beyond the digital realm, I also like mountain biking, outdoor adventures, and video games.
